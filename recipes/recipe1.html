    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is, as called by my mom, my signature biryani recipe. It's healthy and has half of the calories of a normal take-away so that's a bonus!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) container whole milk yogurt</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons finely grated ginger root</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>6 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>1 pinch saffron</li>
        <li>7 ¾ cups water, divided</li>
        <li>¼ cup olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>3 onions, sliced, separated into rings</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, sliced</li>
        <li>6 whole cloves</li>
        <li>5 cardamom pods</li>
        <li>3 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared masala curry sauce</li>      
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Mix yogurt, garlic, ginger, garam masala, turmeric, and salt together in a bowl. Add chicken breast; toss to coat evenly. Cover bowl and marinate chicken in the refrigerator, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place rice in a bowl and add enough water to cover; set aside to soften. Place saffron threads in a small bowl with 1/4 cup water; set aside to bloom.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat a baking dish with 2 tablespoons olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Arrange onions in the prepared baking dish in a single layer. Top onions with marinated chicken breast, reserving marinade. Add 1/2 cup water to the reserved marinade; pour marinade mixture over chicken. Top with tomato slices.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large pot with cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and cumin. Drain rice and add to the pot. Bring to a boil and cook until softened but still firm, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add masala curry sauce; cook and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add parboiled rice and stir to combine, about 1 minute more. Stir in saffron-infused water and 3/4 cup water. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, 5 to 8 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand until rice is fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes..</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Spoon rice onto serving platter; top with chicken breasts, onion, and tomatoes.
